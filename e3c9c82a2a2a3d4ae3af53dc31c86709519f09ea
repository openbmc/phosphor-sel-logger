If you rewrite the file like this with one line missing, wouldn\u0027t rsyslog continue pointing at the old \"end of file\" location?\n\nDoes the next write leave a gap in the file and continue working or result in some error?",

      "message": "The issue here is that, on startup, we initialize the record ID to the last one used and increment from there.  This change will introduce two issues:\n1. This list is lost on restart, so we wouldn\u0027t be able to use all of the freed IDs.\n2. If a freed ID is the last ID before a restart, the next ID will initialize incorrectly from that one.\n\nDo you need to re-use the freed record IDs?  It would be simpler to just drop them completely and stop allowing new records when the record IDs reach 0xFFFE, as you proposed.",
