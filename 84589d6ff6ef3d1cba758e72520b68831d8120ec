      "message": "I think my only concern is that `assert` and `deassert` can be ambiguous depending on if the sensor is supposed to be above or below the given threshold, so you have to know the sensor configuration to fully understand it.\n\nThe current wording also matches the Redfish events.\n\nHowever, I don\u0027t have a strong opinion on it, so I\u0027ll let others provide their feedback before I revisit.",
