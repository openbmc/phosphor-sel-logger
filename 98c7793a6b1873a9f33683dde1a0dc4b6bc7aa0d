But you are right that there is a \u0027right\u0027 configuration where stuff works.\n\nComparing \ndbus-sdr/storagecommands.cpp:1167\nand\nsel_logger.cpp:119\n\nit is exactly the same code.\n\nLets have only one way of clearing the SEL that works and does not have to be configured every time in 2 separate projects.\n\nThere is no benefit to having this configurable, or did i miss it?\n\nMy suggestion would be to let ipmid clear the SEL since thats like the centerpiece of the IPMI implementation whereas sel-logger may not always be present.\n\nIf you agree then i would be willing to create the required patches.",

In IPMI after deleting the files, it reloads the rsyslog service to send it the HUP to restart the new file: https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid/blob/master/dbus-sdr/storagecommands.cpp#L1172-L1177.\n\nIf I remember correctly, there is a configuration option in rsyslog to tell it to immediately create an empty file or wait until it gets a new log to create the file. We currently use the latter, but could change to immediately create a new file, if it would help.",
