      "message": "the \u0027Solution\u0027 to the problem made it worse IMO because now there is even more configurations to keep track of. But you are right that there is a \u0027right\u0027 configuration where stuff works.\n\nComparing \ndbus-sdr/storagecommands.cpp:1167\nand\nsel_logger.cpp:119\n\nit is exactly the same code.\n\nLets have only one way of clearing the SEL that works and does not have to be configured every time in 2 separate projects.\n\nThere is no benefit to having this configurable, or did i miss it?\n\nMy suggestion would be to let ipmid clear the SEL since thats like the centerpiece of the IPMI implementation whereas sel-logger may not always be present.\n\nIf you agree then i would be willing to create the required patches.",

      "message": "If the problem is that the file doesn\u0027t exist, might it be a better idea to delete the older (rotated) files and only truncate the current file? I am not sure if that would work for rsyslogd (does it keep an open file handle? maybe we need to also send SIGHUP or something to rsyslogd.)",
