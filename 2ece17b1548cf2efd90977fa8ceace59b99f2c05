      "message": "A timeout would be necessary because I triggered the scenario where the sel-logger got stuck in an infinite loop. How should the SEL entry be handled if the timeout expires? I do not want to drop the entry because it could be an important message. An option is for sel-logger to assume that the deletion of ipmi_sel file caused the timeout, and the entry should become the first entry.",
