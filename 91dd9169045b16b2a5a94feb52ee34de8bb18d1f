      "message": "Honestly I\u0027ve just used the examples from the other OpenBMC projects, i.e. https://github.com/search?q\u003dorg%3Aopenbmc%20boost.wrap\u0026type\u003dcode\n\nFrom the discord talk https://discord.com/channels/775381525260664832/855566794994221117/1223402897224634379\nI\u0027ve decided to use \"classic\" package for boost for simple cases like here.\n\nIf someone in the future will decide to upgrade boost version, all he need to do is to change 1.84.0 to new version. The build system will help to update `source_hash` value.\n\nP.S. No sure though if I should write anything above to the commit message",
