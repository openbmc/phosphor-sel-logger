      "message": "I agree.  The main issue is with the SEL Delete which was supposed to be a special case that was only enabled when desired.  However, because of this convention of enabling options by default and disabling in Yocto, CI is building only the non-standard config.\n\nIf we want to limit this to just disabling the SEL Delete, I\u0027m okay with that.  I was trying not to play favorites. 😊",
