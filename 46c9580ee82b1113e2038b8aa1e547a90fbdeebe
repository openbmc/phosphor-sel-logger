I haven\u0027t had a chance to review the sel-delete patches.  Does the sel-delete feature flag enable new functionality or does it replace existing functionality with something else that is incompatible.  Obviously for the latter, you can\u0027t do both.  Is that the case here?  I assumed sel-delete was the former because you can\u0027t delete individual sels prior to the sel-delete patches.",
